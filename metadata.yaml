description: "The Inheritors: An Extravagant Story (1901) is a quasi-science fiction\
  \ novel on which Ford Madox Ford and Joseph Conrad collaborated. It looks at society's\
  \ mental evolution and what is gained and lost in the process. Written before the\
  \ first World War, its themes of corruption and the effect of the 20th Century on\
  \ British aristocracy appeared to predict history. It was first published in London\
  \ by William Heinemann and later the same year in New York by McClure, Phillips\
  \ & Co.\nIn the novel, the metaphor of the \"fourth dimension\" is used to explain\
  \ a societal shift from a generation of people who have traditional values of interdependence,\
  \ being overtaken by a modern generation who believe in expediency, callously using\
  \ political power to bring down the old order. Its narrator is an aspiring writer\
  \ who himself makes a similar transition at a personal level only to feel he has\
  \ lost everything.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
